The disease is caused by a Rickettsia-like prokaryote, and full manifestation of the disease appears to be more prevalent in the southern portion of black abalone range (south of Point Conception, CA) where water temperatures are relatively warmer. Die-offs also seem to occur in habitats where water temperatures are elevated by thermal discharge of power plants.  We conclude that withering syndrome has been and continues to be the primary threat contributing to the decline of black abalone. The disease has caused mass mortality and near extirpation of populations throughout most of the species' range, and the disease continues to spread to populations in Monterey County and to the north.

","Precipitation-mediated changes in prey availability are most often related to changes in vegetation. Low precipitation levels result in reduced seed production and declines in the fox's primary prey in most locations, kangaroo rats.  Kit fox populations appear to be positively correlated with kangaroo rat populations. Also, the use of rodenticides is known to adversley affect these rodent populations.
