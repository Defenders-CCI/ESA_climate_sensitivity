The disease is caused by a Rickettsia-like prokaryote, and full manifestation of the disease appears to be more prevalent in the southern portion of black abalone range (south of Point Conception, CA) where water temperatures are relatively warmer. Die-offs also seem to occur in habitats where water temperatures are elevated by thermal discharge of power plants.  We conclude that withering syndrome has been and continues to be the primary threat contributing to the decline of black abalone. The disease has caused mass mortality and near extirpation of populations throughout most of the species' range, and the disease continues to spread to populations in Monterey County and to the north.
